<h2>ðŸ’¬ Hate Speech Detection â€“ Project Description</h2>
<p>This project focuses on identifying hate speech within a given dataset (X data) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to build a model that can automatically classify text into categories such as:

Hate speech

Offensive language

No Hate or Offensive language

The dataset X contains labeled text data, typically gathered from platforms like Twitter or online forums. Each entry consists of a text message and a label indicating whether it's hate speech or not.

The pipeline involves:

Data preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal)

Feature extraction (using TF-IDF or word embeddings)

Model training using classifiers like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or deep learning models

Evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

This system can help monitor and moderate user-generated content in real time to promote safer online communities.
